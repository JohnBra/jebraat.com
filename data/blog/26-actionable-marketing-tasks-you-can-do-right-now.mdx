summary: Marketing is hard. Sometimes, we don't know where to start or what to do next. Here are 26 tasks you can do right now!
---

If I'm completely honest, as a developer I'm not the biggest fan of marketing... The problem is, nobody will
just magically find the products and services we developers are passionately building. The following list is
meant as a kickstart for marketing averse developers (me ðŸ™„) or just people stuck in a rut.

> Learn to sell, learn to build, if you can do both, you will be unstoppable.
>
> - Naval Ravikant

I only included actionable items in this list and some include a small elaboration. This means you should have a clear
idea where to start. Some tasks require more work, some require less. Most of them are not one-offs. I highly recommend
reading the whole list, picking a few items and developing a strategy and plan to execute on them.

Pick something that works for you. Don't start a podcast if you don't have the time to stick with it.

## Launch your product or service

1. Launch your product or service on various relevant websites

The most important one right at the top. Launch! Do it now! Launching isn't restricted to **Product Hunt**. You
should also consider launching in **relevant Reddit communities** (subreddits), **relevant forums** in your niche,
**IndieHackers**, **HackerNews** (Show HN), **BetaList**, or **private communities** you are a part of (Slack,
Discord, Facebook groups etc.).

Bonus: Click [here](https://www.eggradients.com/startup-directory) for a cool directory with 100+ sites you can
launch at.

**If you are launching in a community, please make sure to read the community rules first.** Some
subreddits for example don't appreciate self-promotion, or outright ban it. **Be nice.** I'm sure you don't want
to be part of a public/private community and be spammed with promotional material every second. Be genuine and
offer value specific to the community:

> Hey, I'm an independent indie hacker, and I made this tournament organizing tool for archery clubs.
> Let me know if you like it.

_Side note: Besides the launching task, this list isn't ordered by priority. Launching is the exception._

## Create content for blogs and social media

2. Create memes around your customer pains and post them in relevant communities
3. Write a relevant blog post (on your own blog, [Medium](https://medium.com/creators), or [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), etc.)
4. Write a newsletter issue ([Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/) is a free newsletter tool, Ghost costs money but includes a blog as well)
5. Write tweets or threads related to your customer pains
6. Build-in-public on Twitter
7. Create a brand Twitter account for your product and post regular updates
8. Record video about problems in your niche
9. Record video tutorials for your product
10. Talk on podcasts, and/or create your own podcast
11. Post your product designs on inspiration websites ([Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) is one that I visit a lot)

I personally think video is what we are currently shifting towards. Don't get me wrong. Writing a good blog
article or newsletter issue will still be valid. But, it was never easier to create and distribute videos than now.
If you haven't, you should look at tools like TikTok, YouTube shorts and longer form videos for YouTube for the video
tasks above.

## Put your development skills to use

12. Code a side project related to your core product
13. Optimize your landing page for conversions
14. Improve your website SEO (use tools like [ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) to analyze your website)
15. Add a sharable section on your landing page
16. Add a share feature to your product (Share to Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.)

Code, code, code ðŸ˜Š. Yes, this actually counts as marketing ðŸ™Œ. Don't underestimate the power of publishing a free
complementing tool to your core service for extra traffic. Banks for example offer mortgage calculators. I'm sure
you can think of something to build.

I find Jon Yongfook's approach brilliant. He alternates between dedicated marketing and coding weeks. He even built
a small website for you to never lose track which week you are in. Cool guy definitely check him out:

## Community building and direct contact

17. DM people that might benefit from your product (Twitter, Discord, Reddit, etc.)
18. Engage with communities on Slack, Reddit, Facebook, Discord, etc.
19. Talk to your best users about their problems - are you solving their problems adequately? Maybe you find out that there is a complementing tool you can build to drive traffic to your service.
20. Start a community around your product
21. Create a help center (You can use dedicated tools like [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/knowledge-base), or create your own community/forum)
22. Run giveaways for your users/audience
23. Comment on tweets relevant to your business

<Highlight>DM with caution. Don't be the MLM Karen, ok?</Highlight>

Community building is a big one. It takes consistent work and engagement but the payoff can be immense. Personally
I would look at [Discord](https://discord.com/) or [Slack](https://slack.com/) if you want to start your own community,
but you could also start groups on forums such as Reddit (create a subreddit) or IndieHackers. Facebook is also an
option.

## Emails and Ads

24. Create on-boarding email sequences
25. Create [Drip](https://www.drip.com/) email campaigns for your product
26. Run ads, or sponsor newsletters

## Conclusion

26 actionable marketing tasks you can right now served on a silver platter. Be aware that most of these aren't one off
tasks. Try to pick a few and develop a strategy that works for you. Measure the results: signups, revenue, customer
satisfaction, or whatever metric is important to your business. If it doesn't work the way you hope, change your
strategy. <Highlight>Keep working on it consistently.</Highlight>
