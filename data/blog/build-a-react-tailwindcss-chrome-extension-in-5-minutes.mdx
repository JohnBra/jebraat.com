I have been building Chrome extensions for a while now.

Most notably [Supatabs available in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/supatabs/icbcnjlaegndjabnjbaeihnnmidbfigk).
Supatabs is a an extension to reduce tab clutter and improve your computer's performance. By reducing the 
amount of open tabs you can save up to 95% of your RAM.

In this article I want to show you how you can build a production ready extension in only
5 minutes.

## Start with a template

One of the byproducts of Supatabs is an extension template I built.

The template is setup and ready to go with Manifest V3, React, TailwindCSS and TypeScript.
Instead of webpack I used vite for bundling. In my opinion it's easier to maintain.

Follow these steps to set up your new chrome extension:

1. Go to the [template repository](https://github.com/JohnBra/vite-web-extension)
2. Click the **"Use this template"** button to create your own project in your GitHub.
If you aren't using GitHub just clone the repository
3. Go back to the template repository and give it a star ðŸ˜œ

## Setting up the development environment

Follow these steps to start your dev environment:

1. Change the `name`, `displayName` and `description` in the `package.json`. These properties will be 
used in the build step to name your extension for the store
2. `yarn install` to install the dependencies
3. `yarn dev` to start the development server
4. [Load the extension in Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/#manifest):
    1. Open your Chrome browser
    2. Enter `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and hit enter
    3. Turn on developer mode
    4. Load unpacked extension: Use the generated `dist` directory in your project folder. This will be 
    generated and updated when you use `yarn dev` or `yarn build`

That's all you need to do.

**A manifest with version 3 will be generated automatically for you.**

Whenever you save changes and the `dev` command is running, the `dist` directory will automatically be 
updated thanks to `nodemon`. This means you don't have to do step 4 more than once.


## Implement some functionality

To get a feel for how extension development works, we will implement a simple button in the extension 
popup to open a specific url in new tab or focus it if it already exists in your tabstrip.

### Prepare

As we won't need most of the different Chrome extension pages in the template, we will remove the 
irrelevant source files from the project and modify our config. This is so they won't be included in the 
final build.

**Stop the development server** and then delete the following directories including content:
- `src/pages/content/*`
- `src/pages/devtools/*`
- `src/pages/newtab/*`
- `src/pages/options/*`
- `src/pages/panel/*`
- `src/pages/background/*`

Then we will modify the `vite.config.ts` to look like the following:
```ts:vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { resolve } from 'path';
import makeManifest from './utils/plugins/make-manifest';

const root = resolve(__dirname, 'src');
const pagesDir = resolve(root, 'pages');
const assetsDir = resolve(root, 'assets');
const outDir = resolve(__dirname, 'dist');
const publicDir = resolve(__dirname, 'public');

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@src": root,
      "@assets": assetsDir,
      "@pages": pagesDir,
    },
  },
  plugins: [react(), makeManifest()],
  publicDir,
  build: {
    outDir,
    sourcemap: process.env.__DEV__ === "true",
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        popup: resolve(pagesDir, 'popup', 'index.html'),
      },
      output: {
        entryFileNames: (chunk) => `src/pages/${chunk.name}/index.js`,
      },
    },
  },
});

```

Now we need to modify `src/manifest.ts` accordingly. We will remove unnecessary
config params and add `chrome.tabs` permission to query active tabs.

```ts:src/manifest.ts
import pkg from '../package.json';
import { ManifestType } from '@src/manifest-type';

const manifest: ManifestType = {
  manifest_version: 3,
  name: pkg.displayName,
  version: pkg.version,
  description: pkg.description,
  action: {
    default_popup: 'src/pages/popup/index.html',
    default_icon: 'icon-34.png',
  },
  permissions: [ 'tabs' ],  // <-- this how you add permissions
  icons: {
    "128": 'icon-128.png',
  },
  web_accessible_resources: [
    {
      resources: ['icon-128.png', 'icon-34.png'],
      matches: [],
    },
  ],
};

export default manifest;

```

### Implement

Once we are done with the preparation, we can restart the dev server with `yarn dev`.

We will now add the button to open a tab with a specific URL or focus it if it already 
exists. The implementation will be in React with TypeScript. We will apply styles with
TailwindCSS.

```tsx:src/pages/popup/Popup.tsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Popup(): JSX.Element {

  /**
   * A simple function to query the chrome.tabs api for an url
   * If a tab with the matching url was found we focus it 
   * Otherwise create the tab and focus 
   *
   * chrome.tabs docs here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/
   */
  const createOrFocus = async () => {
    const [res] = await chrome.tabs.query({ url: 'https://www.google.com/' });
    if (res?.id) {
      await chrome.tabs.update(res.id, { active: true });
    } else {
      chrome.tabs.create({ url: 'https://google.com' });
    }
  }

  // Some react code styled with TailwindCSS
  return (
    <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 bottom-0 flex justify-center items-center text-white text-center h-full p-3 bg-gray-800">
      <button
        className="font-bold text-lg px-4 py-1.5 border border-white rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-600"
        onClick={() => createOrFocus()}
      >
        Open or focus tab
      </button>

    </div>
  );
}
```

I won't go into the implementational details, as this is fairly simple react
with a button.

This showcases how similar extension development can be to normal web development.

## Publish

To publish stop the dev server and run `yarn build`

Now you can zip the `dist` folder and [upload your package to the Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish/).

That's it. You just built a Chrome extension with React, TypeScript and TailwindCSS 
under 5 minutes.
