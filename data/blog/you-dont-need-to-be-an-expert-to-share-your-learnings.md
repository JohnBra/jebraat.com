I made a few attempts to share my my experiences on a blog before this one

Been a math tutor, tutor DB systems, systems programming

Not expert enough (master of science)

## Fear of rejection

Impostor syndrome

## What to talk about

Experiences with a specific situation
How you dealt with challenges
How you learned a specific thing
Advice (what works for you)

## Closing thoughts

Nobody is perfect
Not everybody will learn from what you have to say, but there will definitely be 
a few people who will.
