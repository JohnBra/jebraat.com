## What is perfectionism

> Perfectionism is characterized by setting exceptionally high standards of performance and unrealistic goals,
> accompanied by overly critical self-evaluations and concerns over making mistakes. [[source]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7400384/#:~:text=Perfectionism%20is%20characterized%20by,over%20making%20mistakes)

Perfectionism is basically <Highlight>the pursuit of unrealistic flawlessness</Highlight>. The keyword here is
<Highlight>unrealistic</Highlight>. Additionally, overly perfectionist behaviour can lead to
[burnout](https://ray.yorksj.ac.uk/id/eprint/701/1/Hill%20&%20Curran%20(in%20press).pdf) and
[anxiety](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.572.8052&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

Now, considering all aspects, being a perfectionist isn't necessarily just a bad thing. Take for example top
athletes like Michael Jordan or Muhammad Ali. Athletes like these hone specific skills over and over and over to push the
limits of what is thought humanly possible. You could argue some kind of perfectionism is absolutely necessary to exel
at specific tasks. **Self-oriented perfectionism** in your personal life or body of work often comes with some positives
such as:

* A high level of ambition
* Increased motivation
* Increased level of perseverance
* Could lead to world-class performance (e.g.: top athletes)
* Great attention to detail
* Striving to become the best version of oneself

There are a [few different types of perfectionism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7400384/#:~:text=Hewitt%20and%20Flett%20%5B22%5D%20created,%2Doriented%2C%20and%20socially%20prescribed.),
such as **self-oriented perfectionism**, **socially-prescribed perfectionism** and **other-oriented perfectionism**.
In layman's terms, people are generally motivated to do things for the following three reasons:
* For themselves
* To please others
* To avoid social criticism

This article mostly covers how to deal with self-oriented perfectionism as it is the one we have the most control over.

## Why you must keep your perfectionism in check

Working on software is hard. As developers, we generally work out a given problem, plan/pick a solution and then
implement it. There are usually hundreds if not thousands of different approaches to solve any given
problem. So, how do you pick the "right" solution?

Unless the problem is very simple our solution almost always depends on multiple requirements or factors. These range
from performance to scalability, time to implement and many other things. In most cases a single solution won't fulfill
all requirements perfectly. This rings especially true when taking time or money constraints into account (e.g.
deadlines and funding). On top of that, requirements tend to change quite frequently, so "perfect" solutions - if that
even exists - aren't perfect for long.

Perfectionism is essentially procrastination.

## How to battle perfectionism

Pareto principal

Here are a few simple tips on how to boost your productivity if you struggle with perfectionism as a software developer:

1. Set your priorities and deadlines
- be it for learning a new skill (like a new technology) or

2. find the minimal viable means of delivering a meaningful experience to the customer
3. don't get stuck second guessing yourself ("Could this have been done better? Am I using the right tools here? Maybe I should have done that instead.")
-> Assumption: there is a "right" way to implement a solution
-> Don't get stuck in the planning trap
4. stop treating digital products like traditional ones (you can change them virtually at any time)
-> give yourself some slack when implementing a plan. Make a first attempt at whatever you are doing and assume it's going to be mediocre (writers technique: "thinking in drafts")
-> write your first draft and iterate on it
