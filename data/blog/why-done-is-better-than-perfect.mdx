## What is perfectionism

> Perfectionism is the pursuit of flawlessness.

Being a perfectionist isn't necessarily a bad thing considering all aspects. Take for example top athletes. Many of them
hone specific skills to push the limits of what is thought humanly possible.

**Self-oriented perfectionism** in your body of work or personal life often comes with positives such as:

* a high level of ambition
* increased motivation
* increased level of perseverance
* could lead to world-class performance (e.g.: top athletes)
* great attention to detail
* striving to become the best version of oneself

But it's not all roses and unicorns. Overly perfectionist behaviour can lead to

[anxiety](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.572.8052&rep=rep1&type=pdf), **anger** and
**self-esteem issues**.

## How to battle perfectionism

set your priorities and deadlines
- be it for learning a new skill (like a new technology) or
find the minimal viable means of delivering a meaningful experience to the customer
don't get stuck second guessing yourself ("Could this have been done better? Am I using the right tools here? Maybe I should have done that instead.")
-> Assumption: there is a "right" way to implement a solution
-> Don't get stuck in the planning trap
stop treating digital products like traditional ones (you can change them virtually at any time)
-> give yourself some slack when implementing a plan. Make a first attempt at whatever you are doing and assume it's going to be mediocre (writers technique: "thinking in drafts")
-> write your first draft and iterate on it
