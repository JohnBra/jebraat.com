DRAFT

Perfectionism is procrastination

set your priorities and deadlines
- be it for learning a new skill (like a new technology) or
find the minimal viable means of delivering a meaningful experience to the customer
don't get stuck second guessing yourself ("Could this have been done better? Am I using the right tools here? Maybe I should have done that instead.")
 -> Assumption: there is a "right" way to implement a solution
 -> Don't get stuck in the planning trap
stop treating digital products like traditional ones (you can change them virtually at any time)
 -> give yourself some slack when implementing a plan. Make a first attempt at whatever you are doing and assume it's going to be mediocre (writers technique: "thinking in drafts")
 -> write your first draft and iterate on it
