## What is perfectionism

> [Perfectionism is characterized by setting exceptionally high standards of performance and unrealistic goals,
> accompanied by overly critical self-evaluations and concerns over making mistakes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7400384/#:~:text=Perfectionism%20is%20characterized%20by,over%20making%20mistakes)

Perfectionism is basically the pursuit of unrealistic flawlessness.

Overly perfectionist behaviour can lead to [burnout](https://ray.yorksj.ac.uk/id/eprint/701/1/Hill%20&%20Curran%20(in%20press).pdf)
and [anxiety](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.572.8052&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

Now, considering all aspects, being a perfectionist isn't necessarily just a bad thing. Take for example top
athletes like Michael Jordan, or Muhammad Ali. Athletes like them hone specific skills over and over and over to push the
limits of what is thought humanly possible. You could argue some kind of perfectionism is absolutely necessary to exel
at specific tasks. **Self-oriented perfectionism** in your personal life or body of work often comes with some positives
such as:

* A high level of ambition
* Increased motivation
* Increased level of perseverance
* Could lead to world-class performance (e.g.: top athletes)
* Great attention to detail
* Striving to become the best version of oneself

So maybe there is hope yet.

_SIDE NOTE_: There are a [few different types of perfectionism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7400384/#:~:text=Hewitt%20and%20Flett%20%5B22%5D%20created,%2Doriented%2C%20and%20socially%20prescribed.),
such as **self-oriented perfectionism**, **socially-prescribed perfectionism** and **other-oriented perfectionism**.
Generally, people are either motivated to engage in a behaviour for themselves, to please others, or to avoid social
criticism.

This article mostly refers to self-oriented perfectionism as it is the one we have the most control over.

## How to battle perfectionism

Here are a few simple tips on how to boost your productivity if you struggle with perfectionism as a software developer:

1. Set your priorities and deadlines
- be it for learning a new skill (like a new technology) or

2. find the minimal viable means of delivering a meaningful experience to the customer
3. don't get stuck second guessing yourself ("Could this have been done better? Am I using the right tools here? Maybe I should have done that instead.")
-> Assumption: there is a "right" way to implement a solution
-> Don't get stuck in the planning trap
4. stop treating digital products like traditional ones (you can change them virtually at any time)
-> give yourself some slack when implementing a plan. Make a first attempt at whatever you are doing and assume it's going to be mediocre (writers technique: "thinking in drafts")
-> write your first draft and iterate on it
