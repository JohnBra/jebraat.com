summary: I have had a somewhat negative mindset towards marketing. It seemed like only sleazy sales people are the ones doing it. This is how I changed my mindset.

Not many of my internet friends know I dropped out of high school shortly after
turning 18. I wasn't even a bad student... my grades were fine... I simply didn't
see why I should learn things I wasn't interested in anymore. Also, playing 
computer games was a lot more fun than sitting in a room staring at a blackboard ðŸ˜…

I went on to join the army for 9 months as a medic. At the time, this was still
mandatory in Germany.

While serving, I quickly realized this wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of
my life but my future looked somewhat bleak without the high school diploma. It 
became clear to me I needed to think about where I want to end up and take control
of the journey.

## Why goal setting is important

> Success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal.
> - Earl Nightingale

Setting goals is important because it gives you something to work towards. Goals give 
you a **long-term vision** and **short-term motivation**. Without goals we often miss 
a sense of purpose.

Goals can also be beneficial to track your progress and see how far you've 
come looking back. They provide the target [for you to focus on](/blog/mastering-discipline-consistency-and-focus-part-3).

## What is a goal

I think it is important to be very clear about what a goal is.

A goal is generally a **large vision for the future**. It's okay to dream big and set 
goals seemingly out of reach. You can set short term goals and objectives to get
where you want to be.

## How I set personal goals

Personally I start with a vision for several different areas in my life:
1. **Health**: Everything from nutrition and exercise to mental health. What kind of body do you want to have?
2. **Relationships**: Life partner, family and friends. What kind of relationships do you want to have?
3. **Finances & Lifestyle**: Money, daily life. What kind of lifestyle do you want to lead?
4. **Self**: What kind of person do you want to be?
5. **Job**: What's the vision for your career?

Here are a few examples to each question:
1. Don't drink. Exercise every day. Don't eat out more than twice a week.
2. Contact friends and family regularly. Spend quality time with your partner every week.
3. Be able to comfortably retire by 40. Own multiple homes.
4. Inspire others. Bring humanity further by launching a rocket to Mars. Make a dent in the universe.
5. Build a million dollar business.

It's on you to find out what it is you want.

Not every goal needs to be outrageous and it's ok to not reach for the 100 million dollar 
mansion. If you know you will be happy with a self sustained hut in the mountains, or a 
simple life on an island, work towards that.

Once you have decided, I strongly believe you should visualize your long-term goals. The 
simplest way is to write them down, but you could also go further and make vision boards 
or similar things. Visualizing makes them much more real.
