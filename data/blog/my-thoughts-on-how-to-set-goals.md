summary: I have had a somewhat negative mindset towards marketing. It seemed like only sleazy sales people are the ones doing it. This is how I changed my mindset.

Not many of my internet friends know I dropped out of high school shortly after
turning 18. I wasn't even a bad student... my grades were fine... I simply didn't
see why I should learn things I wasn't interested in anymore. Also, playing 
computer games was a lot more fun than sitting in a room staring at a blackboard ðŸ˜…

I went on to join the army for 9 months as a medic. At the time, this was still
mandatory in Germany.

While serving, I quickly realized this wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of
my life but my future looked somewhat bleak without the high school diploma. It 
became clear to me I needed to think about where I want to end up and take control
of the journey.

## Why goal setting is important

> Success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal.
> - Earl Nightingale

Setting goals is important because it gives you something to work towards. Goals give 
you a **long-term vision** and **short-term motivation**. Without goals we often miss 
a sense of purpose.

Goals can also be beneficial to track your progress and see how far you've 
come looking back. They provide the target [for you to focus on](/blog/mastering-discipline-consistency-and-focus-part-3).
