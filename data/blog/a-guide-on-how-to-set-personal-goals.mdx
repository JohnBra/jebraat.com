Not many of my internet friends know I dropped out of high school shortly after
turning 18. I wasn't even a bad student... my grades were fine... I simply didn't
see why I should learn things I wasn't interested in anymore. Also, playing 
computer games was a lot more fun than sitting in a room staring at a blackboard 😅

I went on to join the army for 9 months as a medic. At the time, this was still
mandatory in Germany.

While serving, I quickly realized this wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of
my life but my future looked somewhat bleak without the high school diploma. It 
became clear to me I needed to think about where I want to end up and take control
of the journey.

## Why goal setting is important

> Success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal.

Setting goals is important because it gives you something to work towards. Goals give 
you a **long-term vision** and **short-term motivation**. Without goals we often miss 
a sense of purpose.

Goals can also be beneficial to track your progress and see how far you've 
come looking back. They provide the target [for you to focus on](/blog/mastering-discipline-consistency-and-focus-part-3).

### Decide what it is you want to achieve

I start with a vision for several different areas in my life:
1. **Health**: Everything from nutrition and exercise to mental health. _What kind of body do you want to have?_
2. **Relationships**: Life partner, family and friends. _What kind of relationships do you want to have?_
3. **Finances & Lifestyle**: Money, daily life. _What kind of lifestyle do you want to lead?_
4. **Self**: Everything around personal self. _What kind of person do you want to be?_
5. **Job**: Work and career related things. _What's the vision for your career?_

Here are a few examples to each question (not all my own):
1. **Healthy body**: Don't drink. Exercise every day. Don't eat out more than twice a week.
2. **Strong relationships**: Contact friends and family regularly. Spend quality time with your partner every week.
3. **Optimal lifestyle**: Have the choice when and what to work on. Be able to comfortably retire by 40. Experience other cultures regularly.
4. **Personal Aspirations**: Inspire others. Help people to improve themselves. Bring humanity further by launching a rocket to Mars. Make a dent in the universe.
5. **Career**: Build a million (billion?) dollar business. Build a company that truly values their employees.

At the end of the day it's on you to find out what it is you want.

Not every goal needs to be outrageous and it's ok to not reach for the 100 million dollar 
mansion. If you know you will be happy with a self sustained cottage in the mountains, or a 
simple life on an island, work towards that.

Once you have decided, I strongly believe you should visualize your long-term goals. The 
simplest way is to write them down, but you could also go further and make vision boards 
or similar things. Visualizing makes them much more real.

### Break it down

After setting my vision for each of my life's areas I break down the life goals to mid-term
goals and short-term objectives. In my opinion, a top down approach like this is much better
than a bottom up approach.

Here are my guidelines to break down the big visions. I think in horizons:
- **Horizon 4**: Life
- **Horizon 3**: Long-term visions
- **Horizon 2**: One- to two-year goals
- **Horizon 1**: Current projects (objectives)
- **Ground**: Current actions

An abstract example for my life vision to be my own boss:
- **H4**: Decided to be own boss (life)
- **H3**: Create a business for self (vision)
- **H2**: Short term key objectives to make H3 happen. E.g. Make the first dollar or 10k MRR by year X (job goal)
- **H1**: Projects to achieve the H2 objective (projects)
- **Ground**: On each of these projects are tasks that need to be done as soon as I can (next actions)

Once you have done this for every vision you might notice some overlap between the
different the horizons and tasks for the big visions. That's a good thing and shows your 
goals are aligned and work well together.

If you notice conflicting tasks on any of the horizons, this is a sign of conflicting goals.
Should this happen, I advise to think about what you value most and set priorities accordingly.

## My hot takes, dos and don'ts to reach goals

**There is a ton of material** on how to reach goals out there. I have read countless books and
blog articles to find a way that works for me.

### What you should do 

**Celebrate your wins**. Whenever you achieve a milestone, or something that you worked for
happens, celebrate it! This will generate a positive feedback loop and keep you motivated
to keep going.

**Share your successes with others.** Whether you post about it on social media or simply tell 
your friends and family, sharing your accomplishments with those you care about will help you 
feel even more proud.

**Keep a running list of your accomplishments**. This is a great way to track your progress 
and look back on all that you've accomplished- no matter how small.

**Take a moment to reflect on your successes**. Whether you journal about it or simply take 
a few minutes to yourself, taking the time to reflect on what you've done right will help you 
stay focused and motivated.

**Review your goals and the progress regularly**. You must review where you are and whether
the trajectory you are on is the right one. Without reviews it's easy to slip and work on 
things not beneficial or even detrimental to you goals. I personally review my progress every 
two weeks. I have a recurring task in [Things 3, which I use to manage basically my whole life](/blog/how-i-manage-my-time-with-the-gtd-system).

**Don't let others make you feel bad about your aspirations**. There will be many voices
telling you _"Why do you need to be a millionaire?"_ or _"Why don't you just have one drink? You are boring!"_.
Don't be afraid to be who you want to be.

### Hot takes and don'ts

🌶️ I don't think your visions should be [SMART goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).
Dream big. Screw _"realistic"_! Realistic is what you make it to be. You just have to put in the work.

🌶️ There is a notion to _"tell others"_ about your goals for accountability. This may 
work, but often leads to a false feeling of accomplishment when you haven't actually done anything
yet. People actually must hold you accountable for this to be a valid strategy. Most people don't.

**Don't give up**! Big goals are hard to achieve. Embrace the challenge and don't let setbacks
destroy your overall plan to achieve your vision. Plans will fail. Deadlines will be missed. Review,
reflect and adapt. Get back up and go do it.

## Closing thoughts

> Dreams without goals are just that, dreams.

Learning how to set goals for myself helped me go from a high school dropout to catching up on my diploma,
completing a Bachelor + Master of Science in Computer Science with exceptional results and travel 
the world.

You can do the same, but it will take a great amount of [discipline](/blog/mastering-discipline-consistency-and-focus-part-1),
[consistency](/blog/mastering-discipline-consistency-and-focus-part-2) and 
[focus](/blog/mastering-discipline-consistency-and-focus-part-3).

If you put in the work, you can make it happen 💪
