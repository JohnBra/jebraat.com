2022 has been the year of challenges for me.

Next to a few other challenges, I have challenged myself in February to work on building software business or personal
projects every single day for a whole year. Currently, I'm at day 253 out of 365.

Should you do this as well?

In this article I talk about my why behind it, what I have built and what I have learned.

## Why build something every day?

Good question.

I mainly had three reasons for doing this:
1. Build and strengthen the habit of building software
2. A boost in **building experience**, but also for the **"experience"**
3. Build a portfolio of profitable SaaS businesses

I was partly inspired by Pieter Levels' 12 startups in 12 months challenge, but have also done challenges like this in
the past. One of them was not eating meat for a year.

Anyway, Levels' approach didn't seem right for me, as I'm working full time.

I shifted the idea from **X startups in Y time** to **continuous progress**. I wanted to test my limits in terms of
discipline and consistency, building startups or side projects every day, while also working 40 hours for someone else.

I may start a more **outcome** oriented challenge once I finish this one.

## What I have built

First off my rules for the challenge. There is only one:

> At least one meaningful commit per day

That's it. Simple. **"Meaningful"** is obviously up for interpretation, but since I'm challenging myself I wanted to make
sure I couldn't cheat with menial tasks. Meaningful generally means one of the projects I'm working on made progress in
some area.

Maybe a button here, a lambda function there, you get the gist.

Here is what I have built so far:

- [Shell Buddy Landing Page](https://getshellbuddy.com/) - The landing page and backend logic (lambdas + GPT-3) for
Shell Buddy
- [Shell Buddy Raycast Extension](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/shell-buddy) - The Raycast
extension code for Shell Buddy
- [Supatabs Landing Page](https://supatabs.com) - Landing Page and docs for Supatabs
- [Supatabs Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/supatabs/icbcnjlaegndjabnjbaeihnnmidbfigk) - A Chrome Extension to manage tabs
- [Chrome Extension Template](https://github.com/JohnBra/vite-web-extension) - A template to build Chrome extensions
with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS and Vite
- [Send URL to Things3](https://github.com/JohnBra/url-to-things) - A Chrome extension to send the current browser page
URL and website title to Things3 as a new task
- [ChronoShift](https://chronoshift.io) - A timezone converter, incl. geocoding and reverse geocoding (mainly bug fixes,
as I have built this in October 2021)
- [My Personal Website](https://jebraat.com) - My little corner of the internet
- [My Personal Blog](https://jebraat.com/blog) - Technically part of my personal website, but I keep the blog articles
in git and spend quite a bit of time and effort writing them, so this counts ðŸ˜Š (part of building my presence on the internet)
- [Cynge](https://cynge.co.nz) - A service to create QR codes and collect customer reviews for Google and Facebook
(discontinued)
- [gist: TypeScript Chrome storage hooks](https://gist.github.com/JohnBra/c81451ea7bc9e77f8021beb4f198ab96) - a byproduct of Supatabs
- [gist: React & Tailwind glowing gradient border buttons](https://gist.github.com/JohnBra/79640695b48ada9653359b9adc83d8cc) - a byproduct of Shell Buddy
- **An OG image generator** for my blog ([just functions now](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation),
but this used to be a deployment on Render with puppeteer taking screenshots etc.)
- **Leadalytics** - A backend application to scrape Shopify stores for specific data (tiny project for a friend)
- **A chat popup** - Playing around with iFrames as a start for a new project

That's it ðŸš€

## How it went so far and my learnings

It was quite taxing at the beginning to program every single day. Not only do I program at work, but now I'm also
building after work. I'm not going to lie... It took a lot of getting over myself on some days.

Because it was hard at first, I focused on one task per day. This usually equaled 1 commit.

What helped a lot was planning my upcoming task the evening before. That way, I always new where to start and could plan
smaller things for fuller days and bigger things for less busy days.

I slowly ramped up to more commits. You can kind of see this in my Github commit history. It's amazing how much quicker
I can make connection or spin up anything.

**Learnings so far:**
- Programming every day makes you **much quicker**. I make connections way faster now, and it feels great to ride this wave
of momentum
- It **requires a lot of discipline on some days** to keep going. [You can find my tips on discipline here](/blog/mastering-discipline-consistency-and-focus-part-1)
- As I want to grow these products and businesses I also do some marketing tasks. This includes small product videos,
Reddit posts, Reddit answers, Twitter outreach and forum posts. **Marketing is a ton of work besides just the regular
programming, which I definitely underestimated**.
- If you want **to get stuff done and not just learn new tech use a familiar stack**. [You can find a write-up on the stack I use here.](/blog/my-favorite-tech-stack-to-build-saas)
- It's amazing what you can do with momentum. Looking back on all the things I have built in just 254 days AFTER work
is insane. I think **keeping this momentum is vital**.
- Tech: I obviously learned a lot in terms of tech, but I'm not going to list this here. The list would be too long

## Closing thoughts

Should you challenge yourself to program every day for a year?

I'm not sure. It's pretty intense.

So far, I would say it has been worth it, but we will see how the last â‰ˆ100 days will go. I still need to make it
through the Christmas holidays.

I would probably recommend a challenge with one day off per week, if you wanted to go a little easier on yourself ðŸ™‚

With that, happy hacking!
