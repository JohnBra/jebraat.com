Almost a decade ago I started getting into personal development.

I was lucky to be in a group of friends with very ambitious personalities.

To be honest, I'm not even sure who started it, but we ended up talking about several
books revolving around the topic of bettering ourselves, becoming millionaires etc.

Up until that point many of us were saying things like:

- "Once I finish school, I will start a business"
- "When I have money, I will travel the US"
- "Once I know enough about photography, I will start an Instagram"
- "Once the new year hits, I will start working out"
- "Next week I will drink less"

You may even recognize yourself in some of those.

## The flaw with waiting until you are ready

Maybe you want to have children, better your life in a certain way or even start a 
side hustle.

You think you must earn a certain amount of money, have a house, or _need to know this 
one thing_ before you can finally start following through.

The truth is, we will never be truly ready for most things.

If you keep waiting until you are ready, you will end up waiting your entire life.

## The best time to start is now

There is really not much too it.

You may have noticed this yourself already, but we learn most things by doing.

Once you start doing something, especially at the beginning, our learning accelerates 
multifold.

If you ever wanted to do any of these things:

- Start a business
- Work on a sideproject
- Change careers
- Start working out
- Track your calories
- Track your expenses
- Start investing
- Go traveling

Or anything else you can think of.

Do it know.

There is no better time to start anything but today.
