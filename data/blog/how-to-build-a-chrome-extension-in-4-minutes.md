I have been building a Chrome extension for a while now.

Supatabs is a an extension to reduce tab clutter and improve your computer's performance.
By reducing the amount of open tabs you can save up to 95% of your RAM.

In this article I want to show you how you can build a production ready extension in only
4 minutes.

## Starting from a template

One of the byproducts of Supatabs is an extension template I built.

The template is setup and ready to go with Manifest V3, React, TailwindCSS and TypeScript.
Instead of webpack I used vite. In my opinion it's easier to maintain.

Follow these steps to set up your new chrome extension:

1. Go to the [template repository](https://github.com/JohnBra/vite-web-extension)
2. Click the **"Use this template"** button to create your own project in your GitHub.
If you aren't using GitHub just clone the repository
3. Go back to the template repository and leave a star ðŸ˜œ

## Developing your pages

Now modify the pages
