This is my take on what makes a happy life.

My view comes from a position of privilege, simply because I was lucky enough to be 
born in Europe.

Since I was born into a well developed society, I had all the opportunity a 
person could hope for. Food availabily, relative security, good education systems, etc.

I find Maslow's hierarchy to be an accurate description of human needs.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory that explains why people do the things they do. 
As you can see in the image above, it is a pyramid with different levels.

Starting with the most important needs at the bottom and moving up to less important needs.
The five levels are physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging, esteem, and 
self-actualization. 

People must fulfill each need in order to move on to the next level.

To drive the point home...

Compare my situation to someone born into war zones of the middle east, or impoverished areas
of Africa.

They will first and foremost work towards fulfilling basic needs such as food and security. Only 
after these are secured they can strive towards the higher order needs.

In my opinion it's vital to be aware of this, so we can find appreciation for where we are.

## Being grateful

I didn't grow up in poverty.

I never worried about war or having to starve.

Yet, I wasn't rich. Without going into too much detail, my family is far from perfect.

Developing an appreciation for all the things provided out of the box even though my situation
was far from perfect was a very important step for me. 

It helped me develop a deep appreciation for what I have, rather than looking at what I don't have.
