This is my take on what makes a happy life.

My view comes from a position of privilege, simply because I was lucky enough to be 
born in Europe.

Since I was born into a well developed society, I had all the opportunity a 
person could hope for. Food availabily, relative security, good education systems, etc.

I find Maslow's hierarchy to be an accurate description of human needs.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a psychological theory proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 
1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation". 

The theory is often depicted as a pyramid like in the image above. The most basic needs 
are at the bottom and the more complex needs at the top. 

According to Maslow, people are motivated by their needs, and must fulfill each need in order 
to move on to the next level. 

The five levels of needs, in order from bottom to top, are  physiological, safety, love 
and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.

Now, compare my situation to someone born into war zones of the middle east, or impoverished areas
of Africa.

They will first and foremost work towards fulfilling basic needs such as food and security. Only 
after these are secured we can work on the higher order needs.

In my opinion it's vital to be aware of this to find appreciation for where we are.

## Being grateful

I didn't grow up in poverty.

I never worried about war or having to starve.

Yet, I wasn't rich. Without going into too much detail, my family is far from perfect.

Developing an appreciation for all the things provided out of the box was a very important
step for me coming to terms with "having less".
